# Chattler

The chat app the world has been waiting for.

Fast. Performant. Minimalistic design. We've reimagined what it means to chat on a computer.

## Getting started

Starting a chat with yourself has *never* been so easy. Open two terminal windows. In one, navigate to `server` and in the other, navigate to `client`.
Then run `cargo run` on both terminals.

## Key features

- Character limit of 32
- Chat with yourself, or even with others
- Minimalist by design
